_Exercise 1-1: Looking at how I wrote the instruction for line — line(1, 0, 4, 5); — how would you guess you would write an instruction to draw a rectangle? A circle? A triangle? Write out the instructions in English and then translate it into code._


**English**: Draw a rectangle with its top-left corner at 1,1 and its bottom right corner at 4,4.

**Code**: ```rectangle(1,1,4,4);```

---

**English**: Draw a circle with its center at 5,5 and a radius of 2.

**Code**: ```circle(5,5,2);```

---

**English**: Draw a equilateral triangle with its center at 5,5 and sides of length 2.

**Code**: ```triangle(5,5,2);```

(This one makes me feel uneasy because I wouldn't be sure of how to say how to orient the triangle, nor how to easily make it non-equilateral.)

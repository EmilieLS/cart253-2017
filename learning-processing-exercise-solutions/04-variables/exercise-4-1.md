# PONG Variables

We might need...

* The current position of the paddles (y only, since they don't move horizontally)
* The starting positions of the paddles (y only)
* The dimensions of the paddles (width and height)
* The colour of the paddles
* The speed of the paddles (how far they move per frame up or down)

* The current position of the ball (x and y)
* The starting position of the ball (x and y, probably the centre of the screen)
* The dimensions of the ball (width and height)
* The colour of the ball
* The colour of the background
* The speed of the ball (how far it moves per frame, maybe, including direction)

* Left and right players' scores
* The size and colour of the scores texts
* The location (x and y) of the scores texts
* The required score for victory (in case we want to be able to change it easily)
